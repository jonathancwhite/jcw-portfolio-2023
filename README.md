## My Portfolio

I decided to update my portfolio this year not only to include the latest projects that I have been working on, but also to keep my own site looking modern and fresh. Since I am no longer solely a front-end developer, this is also a great way to keep my skills sharp and ever evolving.

## Other Info

I will add to this readme once I finish the project explaining my reasoning for certain design choices and developmental decisions.
